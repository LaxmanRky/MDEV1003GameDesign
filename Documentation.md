# Space Voyager Game Documentation

## Sprites and Animations Integration

### 1. Game Objects and Sprites
- **Spaceship**: Main player character sprite
  - Controlled through SpaceshipController script
  - Physics-based movement using Rigidbody2D
  - Custom gravity implementation (configurable: 1.0 - 5.0)
  - Thrust power range: 5.0 - 12.0 units
  - Smooth movement with drag factor of 0.96
  - Dynamic collision detection using Continuous collision mode
  - Interpolated movement for smooth rendering

- **Asteroids**: Obstacle sprites
  - Managed by AsteroidSpawner and AsteroidMovement scripts
  - Dynamic horizontal movement with configurable speed (6.0 units)
  - Optional scale animation (0.8 to 1.2 scale range)
  - Automated cleanup when off-screen
  - Pooling system for performance optimization

- **Boundaries**: Invisible collision barriers
  - TopCollider and BottomCollider with BoxCollider2D
  - Screen-width spanning collision detection
  - Debug logging system for collision verification
  - Non-trigger colliders for physical interactions

### 2. Animations
- **Explosion Animation**:
  - Triggered on collision with obstacles or boundaries
  - Managed by ExplosionHandler script
  - Precise duration control: 1.0 seconds
  - Coroutine-based sequence management
  - Event-driven animation completion handling
  - Synchronized with audio through event system
  - Automatic game state management post-animation

## Audio Integration and Management

### 1. Audio System Architecture
- **AudioManager** (Singleton Pattern):
  - Scene-persistent audio management
  - Automatic initialization on game start
  - Smart camera audio listener attachment
  - Cross-scene audio continuity
  - Runtime audio system validation
  - Automatic component dependency resolution

### 2. Sound Effects
- **Explosion Sound**:
  - Managed by ExplosionHandler component
  - Features:
    - Precise volume control (Range: 0.0 - 1.0)
    - 2D spatial blend (spatialBlend = 0.0) for consistent cross-device playback
    - High priority audio queue placement (priority = 0)
    - One-shot playback system preventing sound overlap
    - Real-time volume adjustment through inspector
    - Synchronized timing with visual explosion effects
    - Automatic resource cleanup after playback

### 3. Audio Implementation Details
- **Audio Source Configuration**:
  - Non-positional (2D) sound implementation
  - Dynamic volume control through Unity's audio mixer system
  - Priority-based sound system for resource management
  - Runtime volume adjustment support via inspector and code
  - Automatic cleanup of audio resources during scene transitions
  - Component-based architecture with RequireComponent attribute
  - Fail-safe initialization checks

### 4. Technical Features
- **Error Handling**:
  - Automatic AudioListener management and validation
  - Duplicate AudioListener detection and removal
  - Missing audio component detection with automatic addition
  - Runtime audio system recovery through Update cycle
  - Comprehensive debug logging system
  - Null reference prevention for audio clips
  - Scene transition error prevention

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Single AudioListener enforcement for memory efficiency
  - Automatic resource cleanup during scene transitions
  - Efficient audio component management through caching
  - Optimized audio playback through one-shot system
  - Memory-efficient audio asset loading
  - Smart component initialization
  - Background audio system monitoring
