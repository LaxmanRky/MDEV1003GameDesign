## 2. Playtesting Process and Changes

### 2.1 Playtesting Methodology

#### Testing Phases
1. **Internal Alpha Testing**: Initial gameplay testing by development team
2. **Closed Beta Testing**: Testing with a small group of target users
3. **Usability Testing**: Focused on UI/UX and control scheme
4. **Performance Testing**: Ensuring smooth gameplay across different devices

#### Testing Focus Areas
- **Controls**: Responsiveness and intuitiveness
- **Difficulty Curve**: Balance and progression
- **User Interface**: Clarity and accessibility
- **Audio Experience**: Sound quality and volume balance
- **Performance**: Frame rate stability and resource usage
- **Bug Detection**: Identifying and resolving gameplay issues

### 2.2 Key Feedback and Implemented Changes

#### Control System Refinements
- **Initial Issue**: Players found the spaceship movement too sensitive
- **Feedback**: "The spaceship is hard to control precisely, especially in tight situations"
- **Changes Made**: 
  - Adjusted thrust power and gravity ratio for more predictable movement
  - Implemented smoother drag factor (0.96) for better control
  - Added maximum thrust cap to prevent uncontrollable acceleration

#### Audio System Improvements
- **Initial Issue**: Background music ignored user preferences and played regardless of settings
- **Feedback**: "The music keeps playing even when I turn it off in the settings"
- **Changes Made**:
  - Implemented persistent audio settings using PlayerPrefs
  - Fixed AudioManager to properly respect mute toggles
  - Added immediate application of audio settings changes
  - Ensured background music state persists between scenes

#### User Interface Enhancements
- **Initial Issue**: Score display and game state information wasn't clear enough
- **Feedback**: "I can't easily see my score while playing" and "It's not obvious when the game is over"
- **Changes Made**:
  - Redesigned score UI with prominent current and high score displays
  - Added dedicated high score panel with reset functionality
  - Implemented clear game over and level complete panels
  - Improved button visibility and feedback

#### Game Balance Adjustments
- **Initial Issue**: Game difficulty ramped up too quickly for new players
- **Feedback**: "The game gets too hard too fast, I can barely survive 30 seconds"
- **Changes Made**:
  - Rebalanced asteroid spawning frequency and patterns
  - Adjusted timeline events for smoother difficulty progression
  - Implemented more forgiving collision detection
  - Added slight variation in asteroid movement patterns for better gameplay variety

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Initial Issue**: Frame rate drops on certain devices during asteroid-heavy sequences
- **Feedback**: "The game stutters when there are many asteroids on screen"
- **Changes Made**:
  - Implemented object pooling for asteroids to reduce instantiation overhead
  - Optimized collision detection algorithms
  - Added automatic cleanup of off-screen objects

### 2.3 Iteration Process

The development of Space Voyager followed an iterative approach, with each playtesting session informing the next round of improvements:

1. **Prototype Phase**: Basic movement and collision mechanics
2. **Alpha Phase**: Core gameplay loop with preliminary UI
3. **Beta Phase**: Complete feature set with focus on refinement
4. **Release Candidate**: Polished experience with all feedback addressed

Throughout this process, the most significant improvements came from addressing the audio system issues and refining the game's difficulty curve, which were consistently mentioned in playtester feedback.

### 2.4 Final Adjustments

The final round of changes before completion focused on:

1. **Level Complete Experience**: Added a dedicated level complete panel triggered by timeline signals
2. **High Score Management**: Simplified the high score reset process by removing confirmation dialog
3. **Audio Consistency**: Ensured background music properly respects user settings across all game states
4. **Visual Polish**: Added subtle animations and transitions to improve the overall feel

These final adjustments were made based on the cumulative feedback gathered throughout the playtesting process, resulting in a more cohesive and enjoyable gaming experience.
